  first, translate the camera to 0,0,0
  then it's a rotation to the coordinate system from the point of view of the camera:
    direction away from camera,
    direction up from camera,
    direction right of camera,
  process for orthonormalizing a set of vectors:
    e.g. camera dir + world up into camera forward, right, and up
